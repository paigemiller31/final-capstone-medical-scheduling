Final Capstone


- ERD diagram / data:
	- Are there any many to many relationships / need for bridge tables?
	- Should we have a "USER" table for patient and doctor (and delianate by role), or separate for each?
		(as reference: Movie Database ERD)

- Do we need third party API for:
	- Calendar?
	- Sending notifications - alerting doctor about appointment booking?





TWO PARTS BANK END:
- Database design
- Build the API based on the database

TWO PARTS FRONT END:
- Consuming the API
- Design the layout




----[ for now, we will input doctors on the back end and "give them their username and password" ]

----but, going forward, we could...
----*** doctors can be given a token they can enter to be able to register as doctor
----doctors have an NPI # (?) (some kind of ID associated with doctors)




when a patient is scheduling an appointment (?)

getOfficeInfoByDoctorId:
SELECT office_name, address_line_1, address_line_2,
    city, state, zip_code, phone_number, email 
    FROM office 
    INNER JOIN  doctor on  doctor.office_id = office.office_id
    WHERE doctor.doctor_id = 3
